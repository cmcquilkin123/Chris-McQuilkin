I don't know any Latin. I do however enjoy studying environmental histories of Latin America and other regions. My focus is the Gran Chaco forest in South America. I also like cats. I am further editing this text to see the difference between local host and website. I am furhter further editin this because I fucked up and can no longer see my website formatted correctly, only the local host.
